# `on-peek` and scry
So far in this course we've stayed inside our own agents, poking them, altering their data, etc. However, one of Urbit's big wins is the ability to query (`scry`) data of *other* agents in a structured manner, when they allow it. In this sense, Gall agents aren't just "apps"--they play a similar role to databases.

For example, imagine that you want to find out all the groups a user is currently subscribed to. This is stored in every ship inside the `%group-store` Gall agent. That agent, in turn, exposes some of its internal data through `scry` queries using its `on-peek` arm.

In this lesson, in addition to our own `on-peek` arm, we'll examine some that already exist in the Gall agent-space that you can query on your own. By the end, you should be confident that you can grab any info that an agent exposes to your Urbit.

## Example Code
* [/app/iscry.hoon](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide/blob/master/example-code/app/iscry.hoon)
Copy the file to your ship's `app` directory, and install it as usual: `|rein %home [& %iscry]`.

## `scry` Mechanics
`scry` uses a special rune, `.^` to query the Arvo namespace. This means that it can ask any vane a question about its current state, and get an answer, if the query is supported. `scry` is fast relative to other Urbit operations, since it's a read-only operation; this means that it doesn't have to write an event to disk.

`.^` takes a sample of `p=spec q=hoon`, i.e. a `mold` for the query's return value and the query itself. In practice, the query will have a form like:
```
::  query for Clay (%c) + %y
[%cy /example/path]

::  query for Gall (%g) + %x
[%gx /SHIP/GALL-AGENT-NAME/TIME/example/path]
```
In all cases, the query starts with a `@tas` with the vane letter followed by `x` or `y`.

### `%x` or `%y`?
The `x` or `y` after the vane letter is called the `care`. The care indicates the response type expected
* queries with `%y` produce a `cage` with mark `%arch` and vase type `arch`
  - in practice, not all Gall agents return `arch` as the type: `%y` is often used to query for lists of `path`s.
* queries with `%x` produce a cage with the mark at the end of the `path` queried; generally this mark will be `noun`

### Notes on `arch`
```
::  `arch` definition
+$  arch  [fil=(unit @uvI) dir=(map @ta ~)]
```
`@uvI` is the aura for a hash (of a file), and `dir` is a map of `knot`s representing `path`s or directories. This type is used by Clay for returning files/directories, and by Gall apps (such as `%group-store`) for returning all group paths in the store.

### Using `.^`
The first argument to `.^` is a mold used to cast the response. For `y` queries, this will usually be `arch`. For `x` ones, you generally put mark `noun` at the end of the path, and then cast with a mold that you know will work for the data inside the produced `vase`. We'll see examples of how to figure this out below.

### Example Dojo Queries
Since some of these queries are sent to `%group-store`, we need to add a dummy group so that they'll return data:
```
:group-store &group-action [%add-group [~zod %fakegroup] [%invite *(set ship)] %.n]
:group-push-hook &group-update [%add-members [~zod %fakegroup] (sy ~[~zod ~timluc ~dopzod])]
```

#### `%y` Queries
Sometimes these use type `arch`, but for most Gall applications they now use custom molds.
```
::  all dirs and files in the root path
> .^(arch %cy %)

::  all groups in the `%group-store` agent
> =r -build-file %/lib/resource/hoon
> .^((set resource:r) %gy /=group-store=/groups)
```

#### `%x` Queries
```
::  paths of all chats we're in
> .^((set path) %gx /=chat-store=/keys/noun)

::  full group info for one group (with noun mold and noun mark)
> .^(noun %gx /=group-store=/groups/ship/~zod/fakegroup/noun)

::  full group info for the same group, but with `(unit group)` mold
::  below line imports the `group.hoon` library
> =g -build-file %/sur/group/hoon
> .^((unit group:g) %gx /=group-store=/groups/ship/~zod/fakegroup/noun)
```

## Dealing with Ship and Time
From the Dojo, we can use `/=AGENT-NAME=`, and the Dojo will fill in `=` with ship name and time.

If we're calling from a Gall app, we'd use our `bowl` to supply those values, like so:
```
.^((unit group:g) %gx /[(scot %p our.bowl)]/%group-store/[(scot %da now.bowl)]/groups/ship/~zod/fakegroup/noun
```

## `on-peek` Mechanics
When Gall receives a scry request with `%gx` or `%gy`, it:
1. translates the request and forwards it to the appropriate agent's `on-peek` arm
2. waits for that arm to produce a result
3. processes the result and, if it's valid, passes it back to the caller

### Translating the Request
Gall scrys have the forms below, where capitalized names are meant to be replaced with values:
```
[%gx /SHIP/GALL-AGENT/TIME/example/path/mark]
::  OR
[%gy /SHIP/GALL-AGENT/TIME/example/path]

```
Gall translates `[%gy /SHIP/GALL-AGENT/TIME/example/path]` into `[%y /example/path]` and passes that value to the `on-peek` of agent `GALL-AGENT`.

Gall translates `[%gx /SHIP/GALL-AGENT/TIME/example/path/mark]` into `[%x /example/path]`, and remembers the mark.

### Inside `on-peek`
Look at the `on-peek` arm in `iscry.hoon`. It matches against the incoming paths, of which we match three:
1. `[%y %result ~]`
2. `[%x %friend ~]`
3. `[%x %no-result ~]`

#### Example Requests
```
> .^(arch %gy /=iscry=/result)

::  returns the ship
> .^(ship %gx /=iscry=/friend/noun)

::  crashes
> .^(noun %gx /=iscry=/no-result/noun)
```

### Processing the Result
When the result is produced by `on-peek`, Gall returns it directly to caller if it was a `%y` scry. If it was an `%x`, Gall runs the mark passed at the end of its path on it, and then returns it to the caller, which runs the mold passed as the first argument to `.^`. 

So `.^(ship %gx /=iscry=/friend/noun)` is passed to `on-peek` as `[%x %friend ~]`, and then it returns `friend.state` inside a `noun` `cage`. Because it is a `ship/@p`, our mold of `ship` succeeds, and it returns `~timluc-miptev`. We could just as easily pass a mold of `noun`: `.^(noun %gx /=iscry=/friend/noun)`, which would produce `3.690.144`.

`on-peek` returns `(unit (unit cage))`. A return of `~` is meant to represent the value maybe existing, and `[~ ~]` means that the value does not and will not exist. In either case, Gall produces a crash if `~` or `[~ ~]` is returned by `on-peek`. This is what we see above with the `/no-result` path.

#### Note on Marks
In Gall agents, you'll see `%x` queries use a `%noun` mark, the caller will look at their source or documentation to know what type is "really" inside the vase, and will pass that type as the mold to `.^`. In the next section, we'll see how to examine source to see what type is expected inside a given vase.

## Querying Existing Data
Understanding the `on-peek`s of *other* Gall agents is a big part of Gall development.

Very often, programmers want to make extensions to Urbit that are variations on "query existing data about chats/groups, and then do something." The "query" part of these use cases is done with scry. A bot to monitor chats for invite requests, for example, needs to be able to scry a particular chat's path and check for certain patterns in the messages sent there.

Sometimes these scry paths are documented, but often they're not. No problem! You just need to open up the source of the Gall app that stores the data you want, see what types of scrys its `on-peek` arm takes, what form it produces data in, and build your query accordingly.

Below, we walk through the `on-peek` arms for `%group-store` and `%chat-store` and see how we can extract information from them.

### `%group-store` Walkthrough
We'll refer to [this version](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/9f46f4ce24a0a3650aa3d2317a20fb9713cff7d4/pkg/arvo/app/group-store.hoon) of `/app/group-store.hoon`.

This is the Gall agent that stores group member and owner/admin data. In its `on-peek` arm, we see that it matches 3 paths:
```
[%y %groups ~]
[%x %groups %ship @ @ ~]
[%x %groups %ship @ @ %join @ ~]
```

#### `[%y %groups ~]`
This is the most straightforward. It creates an `arch` (since it's a `%y` scry), and then runs `turn` on all the groups, changing the unique `resource` for each group into a `path`. Finally, it runs `malt` to turn the result into a `(map @ta ~)`.

#### `[%x %groups %ship @ @ ~]`
This is a common form for scrys: some static `path` elements to start (`%groups` and `%ship`), followed by parameters, which are 2 atoms here. We take the tail of the tail of the path (another common pattern: everything following the static elements), turn it into a `resource` (`[=ship name=term]`) and then pass that `resource` to the `peek-group` arm.

`peek=group` simply `get`s the `group` represented by the resource, and thus produces a `(unit group)`. This is thrown into a vase, given a `noun` mark, and returned.

*Key Point*: because the value in the vase is a `(unit group)`, our scry command for this path would look like:
```
.^((unit group) %gx /=group-store=/groups/ship/SHIP/GROUP-NAME/noun)
```

#### `[%x %groups %ship @ @ %join @ ~]`
Here we have 2 static path components, two atom parameters, another static component (`%jonin`), and one more atom.

The first 2 atoms are turned into a `resource` as above (representing a group), and then the final atom is parsed as a ship name and we call `(peek-group-join u.rid ship)`.

`peek-group-join` gets the group at `rid`, and then branches on the group policy type. If the group is `%invite`, the `ship` must be a member or in `pending`. If it's an `%open` group, the ship or its clan cannot be banned.

So we now have determined that this scry path returns a `loobean` representing whether the `ship` can join the group.

### `%chat-store` Walkthrough
We'll use [this version](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/9f46f4ce24a0a3650aa3d2317a20fb9713cff7d4/pkg/arvo/app/chat-store.hoon) of `/app/chat-store.hoon`.

There's no `%y` queries here. The `%x` queries are:
```
[%x %all ~]
[%x %keys ~]
[%x %envelopes *]
[%x %mailbox *]
[%x %config *]
```

#### `[%x %all ~]`
Simple, just produces the whole `inbox`.

#### `[%x % keys ~]`
Also straightforward: returns the keys of the `inbox`, which, if we look in `sur/chat-store.hoon`, are `path`s representing chat names. If we look up the `key by` arm, we see it produces a `set`, so we could cast our result to that.

#### `[%x %envelopes *]`
This is the most complex one (although not difficult), and is left as an exercise for the reader.

#### `[%x mailbox *]`
The code for this path throws out the static elements, and looks up the remaining `path` in `inbox`. Since `inbox` is a `(map path mailbox)`, this produces a `(unit mailbox)` (result of `get` is a `unit`).

#### ` [%x %config *]`
This also throws out static elements, fetches the `(unit mailbox)` at the remaining `path`, and returns its `config` if it exists. So the result here will be a `config` (NOT a `(unit config)`: note how the vase is formed in line 139).

## Summary
In this lesson, you saw how to write your own `on-peek` arms to respond to scry queries of your app's state.

Even more importantly, you learned how to use `.^` to scry any Gall agent that exposes its data through `on-peek`, and also how to understand their source code. This will allow you to query any agent you wish, and build up apps that operate on pre-existing user information to create rich experiences.

### Key Points
* `scry`s & subscriptions let you pull in data from other apps and then use that data programmatically in your agents.
* `scry`s are fast, but processing the data you pull in could potentially be slow.

### Note
`scry`s can only be done on the current ship; you cannot `scry` remotely.

## Exercises

### Code-Reading and `scry` Writing
* Figure out what the `[%x %envelopes]` query in `app/chat-store.hoon` does exactly, and what type of value is in its vase.
* Write successful Gall scry requests to 4 different agents on your main ship. Use both `%x` and `%y`. Some possible agents to query in `/app`:
  - `contact-store.hoon`
  - `eth-watcher.hoon`
  - `hood.hoon`
  - `link-store.hoon`
  - `publish.hoon`
  - `launch.hoon`
  - `metadata-store.hoon`
  
### Chat Admin
For this exercise, you should build your own agent that you can send pokes to. Feel free to do the pokes as `%noun`s as in the [poke lesson](poke.md).

**You will likely want to use an [-L ship](workflow.md) with lots of pre-existing group/chat data for this exercise.**

#### scry helpers
In your agent, create 2 gates in the helper core. Both should take a sample of `[mold app-name path]`
  1. A gate that does `%gy` `scry`s
  2. A gate that does `%gx` `scry`s
  
#### `scry` pokes
Create pokes that perform the following `scry`s:
* get all groups that you are an owner or admin of (`metadata-store` and `group-store`)
* get full chat mailboxes by their path (`chat-store`)
* subscribe to updates from `chat-store`
